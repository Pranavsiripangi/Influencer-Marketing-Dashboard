# ðŸ“Š Influencer Marketing Dashboard â€“ India

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard that provides a 360Â° overview of influencer marketing campaign performance in India.

It includes a gender distribution pie chart, platform-wise reach breakdown, top performer tables, and a clear conversions funnel that visualizes audience drop-off from Impressions to Clicks to Conversions.

Built with a dark theme and striking orange/red accents, the dashboard tells a clean visual story that helps marketers identify which platforms, audiences, and influencers drive the best ROI.
